C/C++ OpenGL Graphics Assignment at Texas A&M Corpus Christi Texas

What Was Done
Created a Battle Zone like game with 2d and 3d green vector graphics, working camera (forward, 
backward, left turn, right turn). 100 Cubes placed randomly as obstacles. Bonus octahedron that strafes 
left and right, and cat. Created a HUD with a locked horizon, crack, crosshair lock, and crosshair no lock.
Created particle effects bullets that fire with limited life/amounts. Simulated a volcano with particle 
effects triggered by the L button. Collision detection when hitting a wall, causes screen crack can be 
removed with C key, and prevents player from going through wall.

The following keys are used:
• W move forward
• S move backward
• A turn left
• B turn Right
• Q turn off/on wireframe
• F fires icosahedron bullets
• C turn on/off simulated losing (Cracked Screen)
• L turn on/off lock on also turn on/off Volcano
• ESC exits
